        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>If you want a small item that's perfect for a grab & go breakfast, these egg muffins are for you! High in protein, low in fat, but still extremely tasty, these portable snacks will keep you fueled on the go with minimal cooking.</p>
          <p>Each muffin is about 123 calories and contains low fat turkey sausage, fresh spinach, nonfat milk, and reduced-fat cheese to help bring down the fat and calorie content, while still maintaining flavor. If you're feeling fancy, stick one in between an English muffin or bagel-thin for some extra carbs.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 C packed fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 C cooked and crumbled turkey sausage</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 C nonfat milk</li>
            <li>1/3 C reduced-fat shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Salsa, for serving (optional)</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Spray a nonstick skillet with nonstick spray, and quickly cook the spinach, just until wilted. Let it cool, then squeeze any excess moisture out of it.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the sausage and spinach with the eggs and milk. Scoop into the prepared muffin tins (it can be helpful to use a 1/3 C measuring cup), almost to the top. Sprinkel cheese on top. Then give each a good dose of the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake 25-30 minutes or until the egg is thoroughly cooked through. Easy way to check the egg - touch the middle of the muuffins. If they are still wet and gooey, they need a little more time in the oven. They should feel cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve the egg muffins immediately, with salsa if desired.</li>
          </ol>
