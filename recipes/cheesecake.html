        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Nothing says holidays more than a pumpkin recipe and this one is guaranteed to make your guests happy if you have it at your next holiday gathering. This recipe is a lighter but still mouthwatering way of making a holiday standard, pumpkin cheesecake. While it can't be called "healthy" necessarily, halving the fat content makes this better overall, while still maintaining the delicious cheesecake decadence you know and love.</p>
            <p>This cheesecake has about 15 grams of fat per serving, while the average cheesecake slice has 32 grams. This is accomplished through using reduced-fat vanilla wafers, unsweetened pumpkin puree, and low fat cream cheese. You can also reduce the sugar if you prefer a less sweet cheesecake. Cooking and pureeing your own pumpkin will add an even stronger taste of pumpkin as well, if you don't mind some extra work. </p>
